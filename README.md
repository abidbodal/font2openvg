# font2openvg

Alongside other large firms such as Sun Microsystems and Nokia, Hybrid Graphics,
Ltd. was one of the initial OpenVG group members, when the OpenVG group was
formed in 2004.

`font2openvg` is a library developed by Hybrid for converting TrueType font
files into OpenVG API instruction procedures, so that fonts can be embedded into
OpenVG applications.

Hybrid was acquired by NVIDIA Corporation in 2006. The library is useful for
embedding fonts into OpenVG applications, but searching online for the original
code reveals that it can only be found as a dependency embedded within larger
applications.

This repository is a re-upload of the original `font2openvg` library. The rights
to ownership still belong to the original authors, as stated in the license
information.

## Build & Run

The source code has been placed in the `src/` directory. To build the project,
invoke Make, which will output the compiled files into the `build/` directory
(which will be created if it does not already exist).

```shell
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev indent libfreetype6-dev ttf-dejavu-core
make
```

The application can be run from the command line using the following syntax:

```shell
./build/font2openvg ["input-path"] ["output-path"] ["font-name"]
```
